"""Common input data census division to custom region conversion script.

This script takes a complete input JSON database in which all of the
data are specified on a census division basis and converts those data
to a custom region basis. The conversion procedure in this script can
modify any complete (i.e., both residential and commercial data added)
or partially complete JSON database, so long as the structure of each
microsegment is identical for all census divisions, but is default
configured to look for files that have complete residential and
commercial data.

The approach employed here relies on the user to run the input data
processing scripts in the correct order prior to running this script.
This approach was taken instead of creating a master script that
calls those other scripts itself to simplify debugging and modification
of the individual data import scripts and also to reduce the need to
re-run potentially slow code when it or another script encounters an
error when the master script calls them.

To help ensure that the scripts are run in the correct order, each
script checks for the correct input file and produces an instructive
error message if the file is missing.

class UsefulVars(object):
    """Class for useful variables to make them available to external scripts.

    This class is setup so that these variables are available, if
    necessary, to external functions for testing or other purposes.
    While this script can convert energy and stock data or cost,
    performance, and lifetime data, it cannot handle both in parallel.
    After creating an instance of the class, the appropriate method
    can be called to populate the instance with the correct file
    names for the input and output JSON databases and the census
    division to custom region conversion tables.

    It is conceivable that instead of having separate methods to
    set the values for the required variables for each case, they
    could be initialized for one case and modified using regular
    expressions, but the approach below is simple, if ham-fisted.

    The different census division to custom region conversion matrices
    are required because the correct math to combine cost, performance,
    and lifetime data is different than the math for energy and stock
    data. The '_Rev_' version of the conversion matrix has weighting
    factors scaled such that the columns (custom regions) sum to 1,
    which is required to calculate the weighted average of technology
    cost, performance, lifetime, etc. across the census divisions.
    Conversely, the energy, stock, and square footage conversion matrix
    is structured such that the census divisions sum to 1, since those
    data are originally recorded by census division, and all of the
    energy use reported must be accounted for when switching to
    custom regions.

    Currently, three custom region sets are supported: AIA climate regions,
    U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) National Energy Modeling
    System (NEMS) Electricity Market Module (EMM) regions, and (for stock/
    energy data only), states.

    Two dicts with identical structure, 'base_dict' and 'add_dict' are
    passed to this function and manipulated to effect conversion of the
    data from a census division (specified by 'cd') to a custom region
    (specified by 'cz') basis.

    This function operates recursively, traversing the structure of
    the input dicts until a list of years is reached. At that point,
    if the census division specified corresponds to the first census
    division in the original data (the order is obtained from
    'cd_list'), the entries in 'base_dict' are overwritten by the same
    data multiplied by the appropriate conversion factor. If the census
    division is not the first to appear in the original data,
    'base_dict' has already been modified, and data from subsequent
    census divisions should be added to 'base_dict', thus 'add_dict' is
    modified to the current custom region using the appropriate
    conversion factor and added to 'base_dict'.

    This approach to converting the data to a custom region basis works
    because this function is called from within nested for loops that
    cover all of the census divisions for each custom region.
    Consequently, the data from each of the census divisions converted
    to their respective contributions to a single custom region can be
    added together to obtain the data in the desired final form.

            corresponding to the current census division, copied from
            the original input data each time this function is called
            by the clim_converter function. This portion of the data
            should be structurally identical to 'base_dict', and
            (generally) corresponds to the data that should be updated
            and then added to 'base_dict'.
        cd (int): The census division (1-9) currently being processed.
            Used as an array row index, so the actual values begin
            with 0, not 1.
        cz (int): The custom region to which the census division data
            are being added. Used as an array column index where the
            first (0th) column is not relevant, thus it begins at 1.
        cd_dict (dict): A dict for translating between census division
            descriptive strings and their corresponding numeric codes.
        cd_list (list): A list of the census divisions that are in the
            input data (the top level keys from the JSON structure),
            in the order in which they appear.
        res_convert_array (numpy.ndarray): Coefficients for converting
            from census divisions to custom regions for residential buildings.
        com_convert_array (numpy.ndarray): Coefficients for converting
            from census divisions to custom regions for commercial buildings.
        cpl (bool): True if cpl data are being processed
        cd_to_cz_factor (float): The numeric conversion factor to
            calculate the contribution from the current census division
            'cd' to the current custom region 'cz'.
        fuel_flag (NoneType): Flag for the fuel type currently being looped
            through (relevant only to EMM custom region cost_convert).

        A dict with the same form as base_dict and add_dict, with the
