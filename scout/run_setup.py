"""Prompt users with options to revise the list of active ECMs

This module prints user prompts to the stdout (Terminal/console/command
window) with options for users to modify the list of active and
inactive ECMs.

Users are first prompted to provide keywords that are matched against
the names of each ECM and used to move ECMs both from the active to the
inactive list and vice versa.

Following these updates to the active and inactive lists, the user is
prompted opportunities to move ECMs only from the active to the
inactive lists based on their desired selections of subsets of some of
the applicable baseline market categories.
